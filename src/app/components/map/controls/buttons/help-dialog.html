  <h3 id="channelvalue">Channel Value (across timespan)</h3>

  <p>
    MUSTANGular displays data for a station using one channel at a time. (See:
    see Display Value) The channel value is the aggregate of all of a channel's measurements.
    Possible values are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>maximum : highest measurement for the channel</li>
    <li>minimum : lowest measurement for the channel</li>
    <li>average : average of the measurements for the channel</li>
    <li>median : median of the measurements for the channel</li>
    <li>5th_percentile : 5th percentile of the measurements for the channel</li>
    <li>95th_percentile : 95th percentile of measurements for the channel</li>
  </ul>


  <h3 id="displayvalue">Display Value</h3>

  <p>
    MUSTANGular displays data for a station using one channel at a time. (See:
    see Display Value) The channel value is the aggregate of all of a channel's measurements.
    Possible values are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Channel Priority : shows a single channel, chosen by the user</li>
    <li>Aggregate Channels : agregates all channel values to a single value</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="channelpriority">Channel Priority:</h3>

  <p>
    This display value option shows a single channel. The display channel is selected based on the user's prioritization of the
    channels. MUSTANGular will display data for a station using the first
    channel, in order of the prioritized list, that has data.
  </p>

  <h3 id="channelaggregate">Channel Aggregate:</h3>

  <p>
    This display value option combines all of the channel aggregates into a single value. Options are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>maximum : highest measurement for the channel</li>
    <li>minimum : lowest measurement for the channel</li>
    <li>most extreme : maximum value of the absolute values</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="binning">Binning:</h3>

  <p>
    The coloring of icons is determined by sorting all of the displayed values
    into bins. The upper and lower limits of binned values and the number of
    bins are selected by the user. The bins are even in width and inclusive at
    the lower and the upper boundary. Any values that are outside of the limits
    of the bins are categorized as high or low outliers.
  </p>

  <h3 id="key">Key:</h3>

  <p>
    The key has checkboxes for each "bin" that allows users to toggle the
    corresponding values on the map. The histogram on the key represents the
    proportion of stations that fall into that bin.
  </p>

  <h3>Station Markers:</h3>

  <p>
    Hovering over a dot on the map will show a list of channels available for
    that metric and the channel used for display (in green).
  </p>

  <h3>Station Chart:</h3>

  <p>
    Clicking on a station will show a graph of the metric data over the selected
    time range.
  </p>

  <h3>Copy Link:</h3>

  <p>Saves a link to the current metric view to the user's clipboard.</p>

  <h3>Download:</h3>

  <p>Opens the data in format of the selected file type in a new tab.</p>
